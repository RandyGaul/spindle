# Brief

We're making a compiler type of project using ckit.h. It will take glsl 450 as input and convert it to a SPIRV blob. We're doing this to support indie game developers who want to utilize SDL3's new SDL_Gpu API. SDL_Gpu provides wrappers around Metal/Vulkan/DX11/DX12. All of these vendors have APIs to compile shaders from SPIRV blobs, which includes their own optimization passes.

This means as long as we can convert to either SPIRV we cover all major platforms, including web cross-compiles. This is because SDL_Gpu uses a tool called SDL_Shadercross that depends on SPIRV-Cross. SPIRV-Cross itself can convert from SPIRV to glsles300 shaders, covering even web platform. Games written in C/C++ can have their shaders written in plain glsl450 (a limited subset) with an enforced-scope of kinds of input shaders, and our tool here we're making will transpile to SPIRV. This covers consoles via Vulkan/DX, Linux via Vulkan, Apple devices via Metal, and emscripten web pages via GLES3.

This compiler tool fills a missing gap in cross-platform shader solutions in the open source/indie world, where the only alternatives are solutions like large engines or large code projects such as glslang (which compile extremely slowly, are difficult to integrate, and have very poor runtime characteristics with complex APIs to wrangle). Instead, we will provide a very small standalone C project here.

The name for this project is "spindle".

# Scoping and Concept

Spindle will simply be like a "front end" compiler, except it will have scoped down input form expectations. Only basic glsl 450 shaders with vertex/fragment shaders are allowed. A single uniform buffer, input textures, control constructs like if/else/while/ternary are supported. Input types are simple and expected types such as int, vec2..4, matrix4. Builtin functions like dot, clamp, frac, etc. are all supported. However complex other types of shaders like geometry or tessselation shaders are just simply not supported, as we want to gracefully map back onto GLES3 shaders.

Uniform buffer layouts must use `std140`. Other layouts such as `std430` or vendor-specific extensions are out of scope for this project and do not need to be supported.

# Implementation

We're using ckit.h to power our C fundamentals with dynamic array (such as apush, apop, etc.), and a Map such as map_add, map_get, etc. We also have `sintern` for string interning to be used by spindle.

When interning compile-time string literals or any nul-terminated strings, call `sintern` directly. Reserve `sintern_range` for substrings that don't have an existing terminator.

We're just starting out the implementation with a lex/parse combination that implements a pratt expression parser by the lexer setting up function pointers and passing to a tiny generic pratt handler.

The next steps would be to flesh out IR format as we expect to emit to SPIRV blob. We want 100% functional conversion and don't really care about optimization much at all, and will consider optimization passes as a future "nice to have" feature potentially. The vendors will compile our SPIRV further onto the target GPU anyways, and have their own optimization passes we can piggy back off of.

We allocate the symbol table, type system, and any related structures ourselves. Don't add defensive null-pointer checks for these systems or for allocationsâ€”assume allocation succeeds and the pointers are valid. The only acceptable null-pointer checks are when validating results from Map queries (e.g. confirming a map lookup returned a value).

Strings passed around the compiler are assumed to be non-null. Don't add defensive null checks for them; if a null string shows up it's fine to crash.

# Preprocessor directives

We do not run a preprocessor. Strip out any `#`-style directives (including multi-line continuations) so they never make it into the parser. Users are expected to preprocess their shaders before handing them to this tool.

# GLSL 450

Here's a simple vertex shader

```glsl
layout (location = 0) in vec2 in_pos;
layout (location = 1) in vec2 in_uv;
layout (location = 2) in vec4 in_col;

layout (location = 0) out vec2 v_uv;
layout (location = 1) out vec4 v_col;

void main()
{
    vec4 posH = vec4(in_pos, 0, 1);
    v_uv = in_uv;
    v_col = in_col;
    gl_Position = posH;
}
```

And here's a simple fragment shader

```glsl
layout (location = 0) in vec2 v_uv;
layout (location = 1) in vec4 v_col;

layout(location = 0) out vec4 result;

layout (set = 2, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D u_image;

layout (set = 3, binding = 0) uniform uniform_block {
    vec2 u_texture_size;
};

#include "smooth_uv.shd"

void main()
{
    vec4 c = de_gamma(texture(u_image, smooth_uv(v_uv, u_texture_size)));
    if (c.a == 0) discard;
    result = c;
}
```

We expect specific form of resource sets:

```glsl
/**
 * For _VERTEX_ shaders:
 *  0: Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed by storage buffers
 *  1: Uniform buffers
 * For _FRAGMENT_ shaders:
 *  2: Sampled textures, followed by storage textures, followed by storage buffers
 *  3: Uniform buffers
 * 
 * Example _VERTEX shader:
 * layout (set = 0, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D u_image;
 * 
 * layout (set = 1, binding = 0) uniform uniform_block {
 *     vec2 u_texture_size;
 * };
 * 
 * Example _FRAGMENT_ shader:
 * 
 * layout (set = 2, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D u_image;
 * 
 * layout (set = 3, binding = 0) uniform uniform_block {
 *     vec2 u_texture_size;
 * };
 */
```

These above are some examples of things we expect to be able to parse, not fully inclusive but just as starter examples for context.

# Format

Don't worry about format. You may run clang-format on the code before the commit using .clang-format file.

# Process

For each major change I should see if a unit test is appropriate and add it to the unit tests, documenting what the test purpose is and expectations of the test. We must also update main to include a test shader to try out any new features we're working on, and inspect the output of stdout to ensure it matches expectations given the input shader.

Make sure to run the output executable of main.c and make sure all the unit tests pass, and that stdout is printing expected output for the given snippets we are running.

# Commenting

It's important to pick confusing or high priority functions and document what is going on in relation to actual GLSL code snippets.	Here's an example:

// Resolve the return type for sampling functions like `texture()`.
// ...vec4 color = texture(u_image, v_uv);
static Type* builtin_result_texture(Type** args, int argc)

The ... means a note related to the above comment. If you want a multi-line note do this:

// Resolve the return type for sampling functions like `texture()`.
// ...vec4 color = texture(u_image, v_uv);
//    more code here
// ...this is a new note
static Type* builtin_result_texture(Type** args, int argc)


In order for the code to be easier to read we must attach some context to key function definitions by comments like this.
